  <p align="center">Intuitive color jittering for any brush.</p>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This plugin endeavors to allow color jitter, also called color dynamics, in Krita. While there is a way to create stamps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WSQvjhjT3o">where each stamp is a slightly different color</a>, I could find no way to allow a brush to change color slightly with each stroke with the extensibility that other art programs do.</p>
  <p>I didn't fully accomplish this because I could find no way of detecting pen down/up events on the canvas using plugins, this plugin does generate new colors with a keyboard shortcut which can be bound to a tablet button, making it as close as I could to having new colors between strokes. This way you can do multiple strokes in the same color before jittering to a new one, though.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Random Hue changes</li>
    <li>Random Saturation changes</li>
    <li>Random Value changes</li>
    <li>Normally distributed* Hue changes</li>
    <li>Normally distributed* Saturation changes</li>
    <li>Normally distributed* Value changes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>*Normally distributed here is roughly approximate (numpy is a whole chore to import into Krita) and more closely resembles a t-distribution with 50 degrees of freedom (presumably normal by central limit theorem). Point is, it weighs the colors so that colors closer to your base are more likely than those farther away, but still allows those distant colors to be a possibility.</p>


  <h2>Setup</h2>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/MalloryMiller/KritaColorJitter"> The plugin can be downloaded from its github page.</a> </p>
  <p>From that page, click the blue "Code" button and then "Download ZIP." In Krita, go to the bar at the top and navigate to "Tools" > "Scripts" > "Import Python Plugin From File." After clicking on that, find the downloaded .zip file and select it.</p>
  <p>The added plugin may be automatically turned on, but go to "Settings" > "Configure Krita" and scroll to the bottom of the left pannel to find "Python Plugin Manager." Ensure that ColorJitter is checked off there. If ColorJitter seems not to be working at this point, close and reopen Krita.</p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>The colors generated by this plugin follow the specifications set in the Color Jitter Docker. If the docker isn't automatically on your screen, navigate to "Settings" > "Dockers" > "Color Jitter" and click that to turn it on. </p>
  <p>Two default shortcuts can be used: Ctrl+Alt+A (generate new random color) and Ctrl+Alt+Z (return to original color). You can configure these shortcuts to be different in "Settings" > "Configure Krita" if you would like, and I recommend binding a button on your tablet to Ctrl+Alt+A if you use one.</p>

  <h2>Feedback</h2>
  <p>If you find any issues using this plugin (which has only been well tested using the Linux 64-bit appimage version of the software on version 5.2.2), please submit an issue on its <a href="https://github.com/MalloryMiller/KritaColorJitter/issues">Github Issues page</a> with the "bug" label if you get the chance.</p>

  <h2>Credits</h2>
  <p>I looked at <a href="https://github.com/EyeOdin/Pigment.O">Pigment.O</a> quite a bit as reference since it also dealt with colors and used the VSCode <a href="https://github.com/cg-cnu/vscode-krita-plugin-generator">Krita Plugin Generator</a> extension to generate a base to build from.</p>
